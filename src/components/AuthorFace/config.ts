    "Hi! I am Alexander Khitry, 20 yo, a frontend developer (React.js).  \
     I am a fourth-year student in BSUIR, my specialization is connected with computer science. \
     When I was 18 yo I tried myself in creating sites for the first time and was very excited about it. \
     I worked a lot to dig in frontend development and finished some courses. \
     I didn't stop there and continue learning something new. \
     I enjoy creating websites according to all modern quality standards. \
     My typical stack is React, Typescript, Sass, Webpack. \
     In current time I haven't got work experience in this sphere, but I am working on some pet projects to hone my skills. ",
